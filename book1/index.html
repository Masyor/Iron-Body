Born on the agri-world of Brocea Prime, a humble planet of rolling fields and endless harvests, Eman was no ordinary man. From his youth, he was blessed with a frame of unparalleled strength and a spirit that burned brighter than the twin suns of his home. Yet, he knew not his purpose, for the people of Brocea Prime were content to scratch and scrape among the dirt, their bodies frail and their minds dull.</p>';

Its surface gleamed with an otherworldly light, and its weight was such that no man could lift it. The people of Brocea Prime feared the meteor, calling it a curse, but Eman saw in it a challenge, and a sign.</p><p class="verse">As he approached the meteor, a voice echoed in his mind, deep and resonant, like the clang of iron on iron. It spoke: "Eman Hol, thou art chosen. Lift this weight, and thou shalt become the Prophet of Gains, the harbinger of strength, the savior of the weak."</p>';

Though it weighed more than a hundred men, he lifted it high above his head, his muscles straining and his spirit aflame. As he held the meteor aloft, a vision came to him: a galaxy of weaklings, their bodies wasted and their wills broken, crying out for salvation. And he knew his purpose.</p><p class="verse">For forty days and forty nights, Eman carried the meteor across Brocea Prime, his feet carving a path through the earth. Wherever he walked, the people gathered, awestruck by his strength and the light that emanated from the meteor. At last, he reached the highest peak on the planet, a place he named Mount Brodin, and there he planted the meteor, declaring it the First Altar of Iron.</p>';

            content = '<p class="verse">From that day forth, Eman Hol preached the gospel of gains. He taught the people to lift not only weights but also their spirits, to forge their bodies into temples of iron and their minds into fortresses of will. He proclaimed: "Iron is prayer, and the gym is your temple. He who lifteth in my name shall be blessed with strength eternal, and he who skippeth leg day shall be cast out into the darkness, to dwell amongst the unfit."</p><p class="verse">The people of Brocea Prime, once weak and frail, grew strong under Eman’s guidance. They built gyms in his honor, filled with sacred weights and holy machines, and they worshipped at the Altar of Iron, where the meteor still gleamed with divine light. And so, the Cult of the Iron Body was born, and Eman Hol became its Prophet, its leader, and its greatest champion.</p>';
